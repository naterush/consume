# consume

This is a repo where I will be keeping track of things to eat: specifically, books and papers. Recipe reccomendations creatly appreciated.

Each file contains a reading list for the subjects they are labeled by. Each reading list is (hopefully) in the correct order of consumption.

## FAQ

### Why only books and papers?

Because I can print them. Unfortunatly, I suffer from an extreme case of internet addiction, and so as much I'd love to watch informational videos, this would make it far to easy for me to get distracted. For now (untill I come up with a solution to the distraction problem), I'm going to try to go totally vegan (or some other intense diet); only things that can be served on paper are allowed.
